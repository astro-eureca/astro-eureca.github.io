Run the pipeline on these filtered cal files to create a new segmentation mask (seg_1). Optionally dilate the segments to better cover faint extended emission. \n",

    "Stage 3 of the pipeline will run tweakreg to do an astrometry correction either using a GAIA catalog or a custom catalog you input.  A custom catalog option was not available for early versions of the pipeline, so we used external routines and I haven't tested the pipeline version, but I include some (untested) instructions for this.\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "On catalog, I've found that using GAIA generally doesn't work well for MIRI (not many matches with high SNR).  Long wavelength NIRCam imaging corrected to GAIA is ideal, but use whatever band with good astrometry that is closest to your MIRI filter.  If you have multiple MIRI filters, I found it's good to correct the shortest filter and then march it up (i.e. correct F770W to a F444W catalog, then correct F1000W to a the corrected F770W catalog).  I find that using as many matches as possible does as well or better than trying to pick compact sources."
